# Quick-Start Guide for Render Deployment

## Local Setup (Already Completed)

We've added the following files to your project:

- `render.yaml` - Blueprint for Render services
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration
- `nginx.conf` - Web server configuration
- `Procfile` - Process declaration for Render
- `render-build.sh` - Build script

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add Render deployment configuration"
    git push origin main
    ```

2. **Create a Render Account**

    - Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
    - Sign up using GitHub

3. **Create a Blueprint Instance**

    - In the Render dashboard, go to "Blueprints"
    - Click "New Blueprint Instance"
    - Select your GitHub repository
    - Render will automatically detect your `render.yaml` file

4. **Set Environment Variables**

    - Render will set most variables from the `render.yaml` file
    - Check the "Environment" tab to ensure all required variables are set

5. **Deploy**

    - Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process
    - Wait for the build and deployment to complete

6. **Access Your Application**
    - Once deployed, your app will be available at:
      `https://laravel-react-app.onrender.com` (or the URL provided by Render)
